# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
* I felt good in this section.  I am curious about how to autofill the Object arrays, rather than writing in the values for each key.  Piper and I worked together to add a `for` statement into challenge 2.  This was really good for me today as I strugged with the for statements at the end of yesterday. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
* I took methodical notes during this section, which helped me a lot.  I think it took more time, but I struggled less.  I'm trying to write color coded notes to visualize the syntax more.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
* I go to google before I ask a peer for help.  Sometimes that leads me down a rabbit hole, but I'm finding I find the answer on my own a lot.  I'm also utilizing the console and replit more today and that is helping me debug quicker.
